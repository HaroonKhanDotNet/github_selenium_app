# Foundation Exam: International Software Testing Qualifications Board

## Introduction

### Why ISTQB
ISTQB is one of the world's most recognized certifications for software testing. In the last few years, it has become the standard for most applicants looking to break into the world of testing. The ISTQB offers testers a standardized set of terms, processes, and procedures that finesse our curious mind and book finding abilities. And whilst anyone absolutely can become a software tester without it, ***ISTQB foundation level certificate*** show us how we can elevate our application to the top of the pile.

### Terminology is key
 The terminology within the ISTQB Foundation is very **particular** and **precise** for a reason. This assures that all testers that go through the foundation level of the ISTQB have the same understanding of the terminology. Regardless if that test their experience level or career background, if they've been through the ISTQB Foundation, they should have the same definition, for example, of the term *acceptance criteria*. It also allows for clearer understanding between similar words and terms. Without understanding the *ISTQB glossary*, the terms *bug*, *defect*, and *error* may all be used interchangeably to describe the same situation when finding a problem in a piece of software. With the glossary, we were given a clear definition between the three, and can then associate these definitions to different scenarios that they would belong to. This is incredibly important with the ISTQB Foundation exam paper. Within the exam, there will usually be answers that are very close to being correct, but may use slightly different or similar terminology to try and trick us up. Understanding the terminology within the ISTQB foundation coursework will mean that we will recognize the incorrect answers based on our understanding of the terms used.

### Learning objective types and how to use them
 The work within the ISTQB Foundation Software Tester coursework and the syllabus can be broken into *learning objectives*. These learning objectives, also known as *cognitive levels of knowledge*, help to measure how well a tester should understand this information and what the tester may need to do with it once the tester recall it. There are three levels of learning objective.

 - #### K1: Remember - To recognize and recall ISTQB Term
   K1 looks at the candidate's ability to recognize, remember, and recall a term or concept. This could in theory apply to all of the work within the course and the syllabus. However, specific examples of the K1 learning objective can be: identify typical objectives of testing, being able to recognize the definition of failure within the ISTQB glossary, define risk level by using the likelihood and impact.

 - #### K2: Understand - To understand the reasons/statements behind ISTQB Term
   K2 looks at the candidate's ability to select the reasons or explanations for statements relating to a topic and can summarize, compare, classify, categorize, and give examples for the testing concept. Some examples of the K2:Understand learning objectives in the syllabus can include: distinguishing between the root cause of a defect and its effects, explaining the impact of context on the test process, and explaining the differences and similarities between integration and system testing.

 - #### K3: Apply - To apply the concept explained in ISTQB Term
   K3 looked at the candidate's ability to select the correct application of a concept or technique and apply it to a given context. Some examples of this learning objective can include: identifying boundary values for valid and invalid partitions, writing a defect report, covering a defect found during testing, and applying a review technique to a work product to find defects. These three learning objectives cover the whole syllabus for the ISTQB Foundation Software Testing Certification.

## Fundamentals of Testing

### What is Testing
1. There is a very common misconception that software testing is the act of using a piece of software or a system and reporting if it works. The reality is that there are many different sides to the testing process, including, but not limited to, *test planning*, *test execution*, *analyzing results*, *designing and implementing tests*, *reporting test progress*, *evaluating the **system under test***. 

   There is also the difference between: 
   - #### Dynamic Tesing: 
     If a *system* or *component* is under test, then it is known as a dynamic test. A form of dynamic testing can be the execution of a workflow within a system to ensure that it works, often seen as a normal testing activity.
   - #### Static Testing:
     If a system is not directly being used as part of the testing, then it is a static test. A form of static testing could be reading a technical description of the system that has not yet been created and asking questions that lead to changes in the design based on issues not yet introduced into the system. 

2. Another misconception about software testing is that it focuses entirely on verifying the *user stories* and other *system requirements* created during the system's making. It's true that testing does focus on ensuring that a system meets certain requirements, but it also involves *validation* (This can include checking the system under test will meet user needs such as accessibility).

   For a typical project, the objectives of testing may include:
   - #### preventing defects by evaluating requirements
   - #### user stories
   - #### designs
   - #### and code
   - #### verifying if all specified requirements have been fulfilled
   - #### checking whether the system under test is complete
   - #### to validate if it works as the users and other stakeholders expect
   - #### to build confidence in the system under test
   - #### to find defects and failures, thus reducing the level of risk of inadequate software
   - #### to provide sufficient information to stakeholders to allow them to make informed decisions regarding the system under test
   - #### to comply with contractual, legal, or regulatory requirements or standards. 

3. Within testing it is also important to understand the difference between: 
   - #### Testing: Executing tests can show failures that are caused by defects in the system
   - #### Debugging: Is the development activity that finds, analyzes, and fixes such defects. However, in *agile development* and in some other *software development life cycles*, testers maybe involved in debugging and component testing.
